How to use Signals in Angular projects

Angular Signals are a relatively new concept introduced in Angular to manage state in a more efficient and reactive way. Similar to other reactive programming concepts, signals in Angular provide a simpler and more declarative approach to handling state and changes within components. They allow components to automatically react to changes in their state, without requiring manual subscription or reliance on complex external state management solutions like RxJS.
